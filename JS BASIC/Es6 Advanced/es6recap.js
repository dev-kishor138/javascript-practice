1. let const
2. template string
2:a. use varialbe
2:b. use object property
3. arrow function
3.a with one parameter. will return the number after dividing by 5
3:b. with two parameters. will add two to each number and then multiply the result.
3.c three parameters. will multiply all three parameters.

4. [home work]: javascript function declaration vas arrow function
5. array of numbers. and then map to get each elements multiplied by 5. must use arrow function.
6. [challenging]: numbers of array. get odd numbers by using filter with arrow function 
7. [challanging]: array of objets (g,f products). use find to get the object with price 5000.
8. you have an object. now use destructing to create  a simple (or more) variable to get the third element of the array in a variable called 'three'
